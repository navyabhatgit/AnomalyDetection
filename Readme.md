# Credit Card Transaction Anomaly Detection

## Overview
This project focuses on implementing various anomaly detection methods for credit card transactions. The goal is to identify fraudulent transactions accurately while minimizing false positives. In addition to traditional anomaly detection techniques, a novel coefficient of correlation will be explored to gain deeper insights into the data and enhance anomaly detection performance.

## Motivation
Credit card fraud is a significant concern for financial institutions and consumers alike. Detecting fraudulent transactions promptly is crucial for preventing financial losses and maintaining trust in the banking system. Traditional methods of anomaly detection may not always be sufficient in detecting sophisticated fraudulent activities. Hence, there is a need to explore innovative approaches to enhance detection accuracy.

## Objectives
- Implement and evaluate different anomaly detection algorithms such as Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor (LOF), and One-Class SVM.
- Develop and analyze a new coefficient of correlation tailored for credit card transaction data.
- Compare the performance of existing methods with the proposed coefficient of correlation approach.
- Provide insights and recommendations for effective fraud detection strategies based on experimental results.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the credit card transaction dataset, handling missing values and outliers appropriately.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Gain insights into the dataset through visualizations and statistical summaries.
3. **Anomaly Detection Algorithms Implementation**: Implement Isolation Forest, LOF, One-Class SVM, and other relevant anomaly detection methods.
4. **Development of Coefficient of Correlation**: Design and implement a new coefficient of correlation tailored for credit card transaction data.
5. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of each anomaly detection method using appropriate metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. **Comparison**:
7. **Documentation**:
